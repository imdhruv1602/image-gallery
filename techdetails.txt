Use CSS or JavaScript to create smooth transitions and overlays for the lightbox effect.

Add filtering options to allow users to sort images based on categories, tags, or other criteria.
Use CSS or JavaScript to create interactive filter buttons.
Accessibility:
Ensure the image gallery is accessible to all users. Add alt text to images for screen readers.
Test keyboard navigation and focus management within the gallery.
Animations and Transitions:
Apply subtle animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
Use CSS transitions or JavaScript libraries for smooth effects.
Responsive Design:
